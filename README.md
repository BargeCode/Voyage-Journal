Little personal python project for RPI4

This is an app im working on for inland barges. programming is sort of a hobby of mine. Since im a inland-barge captain without programming education. 

In the end, i hope the app can tell me with which RPM's are gonna get me and the boat, at my destination with the least amount of diesel consumed. 
Again, im doing this, just for fun and to try and learn python.
